# Product Description

## Vision
A single, cloud-based marketplace that bridges the gap between affordable Certified Public Accountant (CPA) talent and authoritative, real-time legal interpretation from licensed tax attorneys.  The platform empowers:

* **Lawyers** – to publish timely explanations of new or amended tax legislation and regulatory guidance.
* **CPAs** – to quickly find authoritative answers and recommended workflows so they can serve clients accurately and confidently.
* **Business Clients** – to hire vetted, cost-efficient CPAs for everyday bookkeeping as well as niche, high-complexity tax situations.

The result is a streamlined, trustworthy ecosystem where every stakeholder wins: lawyers monetize their expertise, CPAs reduce research time and liability, and businesses receive professional, compliant financial services at a lower price point.

## Core Value Proposition
1. **Authoritative Compliance** – Every answer is backed by a named attorney and linked directly to source law or IRS publications.
2. **Lower Cost of Service** – By off-loading interpretation to specialists, CPAs can focus on execution, keeping overall labour costs down.
3. **Speed** – Rule changes are published to the platform within hours, not weeks, drastically reducing the lag between legislation and practice.
4. **Transparency & Trust** – Ratings, peer reviews, and immutable change logs give businesses confidence in both the CPA they hire and the legal guidance they follow.
