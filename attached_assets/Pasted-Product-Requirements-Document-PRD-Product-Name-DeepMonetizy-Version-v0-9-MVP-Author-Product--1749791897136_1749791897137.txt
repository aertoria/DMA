1. Purpose & Vision

DeepMonetizy is an AI-assisted “Cursor-style” IDE for growth teams. It lets marketers design, run, and iterate A/B (and multivariate) campaigns as visually as developers manipulate code. The goal is to reduce campaign build time from days to minutes, unlock rapid experimentation, and surface data-driven insights automatically.

2. Objectives & Success Metrics

Objective	KPI (Target @ 90 days post-launch)
Shrink campaign setup time	↓ 80 % vs. current baseline
Increase experiment velocity	≥ 5 A/B tests per active workspace / month
Lift conversion rate on primary CTA	+10 % average over baseline funnels
User satisfaction (PMF survey)	≥ 60 % “very satisfied”
Activation (first flow published)	≥ 70 % of new workspaces within 7 days

3. Personas

Persona	Goals	Pain Points Today
Growth Marketer “Gina”	Launch many experiments without dev help	Dev backlog, tool fragmentation
Marketing Ops Lead “Omar”	Maintain governance & data integrity	Shadow IT, disconnected data silos
SMB Founder “Felix”	DIY marketing with limited time	Steep learning curves, no in-house experts

└──────────────┴───────────────────────────────┴───────────────┘

	•	Look & feel: Dark/light themes, monospace UI akin to Cursor / VS Code with sidebars, tabbed editors, and command palette (⌘K).
	•	Zero-state onboarding: Pre-built “starter’’ flows (email drip, SEO test, Ads split).

M-2	Core nodes: Email, SEO Experiment, Ad Creative, Webhook, Delay/Wait, Decision Split (A/B/Multivariate).
M-3	Support inline code in TypeScript/Python for power users; tabs appear above canvas.
M-4	Version control: diff view, branch & merge, revert.
M-5	Real-time validation (e.g., missing connector errors, infinite loop detection).
M-6	“Run” and “Preview” modes with stub data.

5.3 Right Panel (AI Chat Box)

FR-ID	Requirement
R-1	GPT-4o-powered chat; contextual awareness of selected node and workspace.
